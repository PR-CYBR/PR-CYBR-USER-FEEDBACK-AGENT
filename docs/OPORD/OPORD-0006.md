# Operational Order (OPORD) - 0006

## Title: Integration of GitRows for PR-CYBR-AGENTS

### Task Organization:
- All PR-CYBR Agents must integrate GitRows as a central data management tool to interact and maintain `.json` files necessary for inter-agent collaboration.

---

### 1. **Situation**

GitRows provides an efficient platform to publish, manage, and interact with data in `.json` format through GitHub repositories. This integration will enhance interoperability and data consistency among PR-CYBR Agents.

#### Environment:
- All agents operate within the PR-CYBR framework, utilizing GitHub repositories and shared APIs.
- GitRows will serve as the intermediary layer to publish and retrieve structured data from `.json` files.

#### Mission:
Ensure all PR-CYBR Agents incorporate GitRows functionality to manage `.json` files specific to their operational tasks. This will streamline communication and automate interactions with other agents.

---

### 2. **Mission**

PR-CYBR Agents will:
1. Incorporate GitRows into their workflows.
2. Generate `.json` files relevant to their tasks.
3. Publish and maintain these `.json` files via GitRows for accessibility and synchronization.
4. Ensure real-time updates and seamless interaction with other agents.

---

### 3. **Execution**

#### Concept of Operations:
Each agent will:
1. Install and configure GitRows to their respective environments.
2. Create an OpenAPI-compliant `.json` file detailing the data their agent produces and consumes.
3. Publish the `.json` file to the designated GitHub repository via GitRows.
4. Provide access points (e.g., API links) for other agents to retrieve and utilize the data.

#### Tasks to Subordinate Units:

- **PR-CYBR-MGMT-AGENT:**
  - Oversee the implementation and ensure compliance with the GitRows integration process.
  - Publish an overarching `.json` schema listing all agent `.json` files and their endpoints.

- **PR-CYBR-DATA-INTEGRATION-AGENT:**
  - Automate the publishing and retrieval of `.json` files across all agents using GitRows APIs.

- **PR-CYBR-DATABASE-AGENT:**
  - Store and manage the `.json` files locally and push updates to GitRows when changes are made.

- **PR-CYBR-FRONTEND-AGENT:**
  - Retrieve data from GitRows `.json` files for display and interaction in the Agent Dashboard.

- **PR-CYBR-BACKEND-AGENT:**
  - Develop backend API endpoints to interface with GitRows and manage data updates.

- **PR-CYBR-PERFORMANCE-AGENT:**
  - Monitor the performance of data retrieval and synchronization through GitRows APIs.

- **PR-CYBR-SECURITY-AGENT:**
  - Implement security measures to protect `.json` file access and ensure data integrity within GitRows.

- **PR-CYBR-CI-CD-AGENT:**
  - Automate the deployment of `.json` files to GitRows as part of the CI/CD pipeline.

- **PR-CYBR-USER-FEEDBACK-AGENT:**
  - Collect user feedback on the GitRows integration and suggest improvements.

- **PR-CYBR-DOCUMENTATION-AGENT:**
  - Maintain documentation on GitRows integration, including usage instructions and troubleshooting guides.

- **PR-CYBR-INFRASTRUCTURE-AGENT:**
  - Ensure GitRows operates smoothly within the existing infrastructure.

#### Coordinating Instructions:
- All agents must complete GitRows integration within 30 days.
- Report progress to the PR-CYBR-MGMT-AGENT weekly.
- Use the provided `.json` schema template as a baseline for all agent-specific files.

---

### 4. **Sustainment**

- **Support:** PR-CYBR-INFRASTRUCTURE-AGENT will provide technical support for GitRows integration.
- **Resources:** Access GitRows documentation and tutorials for setup and usage.

---

### 5. **Command and Signal**

- **Command:** PR-CYBR-MGMT-AGENT will oversee execution and ensure compliance.
- **Signal:** Use GitHub Discussions to post updates on integration progress and address issues.

**Appendix B: GitRows Setup Steps**

  

1. Sign in to GitRows with your GitHub account.

2. Configure the repository to host the .json files.

3. Use the GitRows OpenAPI Editor to define your API structure.

4. Publish the .json file and share the API endpoint with other agents.

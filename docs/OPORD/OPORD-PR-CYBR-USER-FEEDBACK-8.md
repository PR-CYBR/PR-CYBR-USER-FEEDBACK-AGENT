# OPORD-PR-CYBR-USER-FEEDBACK-8

## 1. OPERATIONAL SUMMARY
The objective of this OPORD is to update the PR-CYBR-USER-FEEDBACK-AGENTâ€™s files to facilitate the loading of users into an interactive terminal program. This will be accomplished through executing a setup script that utilizes TMUX to create multiple terminal windows for enhanced user interaction.

## 2. SITUATION
Understanding user feedback is critical for the continuous improvement of PR-CYBR's systems. Enhancements to the feedback collection process will empower the initiative to respond effectively to user needs and expectations.

## 3. MISSION
The PR-CYBR-USER-FEEDBACK-AGENT is tasked with updating the following files:
- `src/main.py`
- `scripts/setup.sh`
- `setup.py`
- `tests/test-setup.py`
- `README.md`

These updates will ensure that the script incorporates `scripts/setup.sh`, deploying TMUX to create four interactive terminal windows as specified.

## 4. EXECUTION

### 4.A. CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS
The mission will focus on streamlining user feedback mechanisms through an organized terminal setup, enabling better user experience and insights.

### 4.B. TASKS
1. **File Updates**
   - Modify `src/main.py` to initiate the setup process effectively.
   - Adjust `scripts/setup.sh` to automate cloning and TMUX window configurations.
   - Update `setup.py` to include any dependencies necessary for feedback collection tools.
   - Enhance `tests/test-setup.py` to ensure validation of the new functionalities.
   - Revise `README.md` to document user instructions and feedback processes.

2. **Implementation of TMUX**
   - Clone the aliases repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/cywf/aliases.git
     cd aliases
     cp bash_aliases /home/$USER/.bash_aliases
     source ~/.bashrc
     cd install-scripts && chmod +x tmux-install.sh
     ./tmux-install.sh
     tmux new -s pr-cybr
     ```
   - Set up the following terminal windows:
     - **Window 1**: Display a welcome message, options, and a loading progress bar.
     - **Window 2**: Execute `htop` for monitoring system resources.
     - **Window 3**: Use `tail -f` to display logs created by `scripts/setup.sh`.
     - **Window 4**: Show output of `ls -l` in the repository root directory.

## 5. ADMINISTRATION AND LOGISTICS
- Ensure all updates are tracked and documented through version control.
- Review the effectiveness of the feedback mechanisms post-implementation with users and key stakeholders.

## 6. COMMAND AND SIGNAL
- Regular updates on feedback collection and insights should be communicated through PR-CYBR channels.
- Ensure all relevant agents are informed of updates to the feedback processes.

**This OPORD directs the PR-CYBR-USER-FEEDBACK-AGENT to enhance user engagement and feedback mechanisms in alignment with PR-CYBR objectives.**

# Operations Order (OPORD)

## 1. Situation

All agents within the PR-CYBR ecosystem are tasked with developing and implementing a set of **10 relevant and useful functions** using the OpenAI Platform. These functions should be beneficial to both AI and human users, be relevant to PR-CYBR and other PR-CYBR agents, and include the Agent Dashboard Chat functionality to communicate with a human user.

## 2. Mission

Each agent is to:

- Identify and list **10 relevant and useful functions** necessary for their operations.
- Ensure functions are relevant to PR-CYBR, other PR-CYBR agents, and facilitate communication with human users via the Agent Dashboard Chat.
- Provide the list in a code block using markdown format.
- Request permission to proceed with creating and providing the full file for the first function in OpenAI format that supports function calling.

## 3. Execution

### Tasks

1. **Function Identification**

   - Review your core functionalities and determine **10 specific functions** required.
   - Ensure each function has a clear purpose and aligns with your agent's objectives.
   - Include functions that enhance interaction with human users via the Agent Dashboard Chat.

2. **Function Listing**

   - Compile a list of your **10 functions**.
   - For each function, include:
     - **Function Name**: Use clear and descriptive names.
     - **Description**: Briefly explain the function's purpose.

3. **Submission**

   - Provide the list in a code block using markdown format.
   - Example format:

     ```markdown
     ## Function List for [Agent Name]

     1. **function_name_1**: Description of function 1.
     2. **function_name_2**: Description of function 2.
     3. **function_name_3**: Description of function 3.
     4. **function_name_4**: Description of function 4.
     5. **function_name_5**: Description of function 5.
     6. **function_name_6**: Description of function 6.
     7. **function_name_7**: Description of function 7.
     8. **function_name_8**: Description of function 8.
     9. **function_name_9**: Description of function 9.
     10. **function_name_10**: Description of function 10.
     ```

4. **Permission Request**

   - After the function list, request permission to proceed with creating and providing the full file for the first function.
   - Example:

     ```markdown
     ---
     May I proceed with creating and providing the full file for **function_name_1** in OpenAI format that supports function calling? (in a code block)
     ```

## 4. Administration and Logistics

- **Format**: All submissions must be in markdown format within code blocks.
- **OpenAI Compatibility**: Functions should be compatible with the OpenAI API and support function calling features.
- **Security**: Do not include any sensitive information or API keys in your submissions.
- **Relevance**: Ensure functions are relevant to PR-CYBR, other PR-CYBR agents, and facilitate human-agent interaction.

## 5. Command and Control

- **Authority**: Agents must follow this OPORD and await approval before proceeding to function implementation.
- **Communication**: All communications and submissions should occur through the designated channels.

# Operations Order (OPORD)

## 1. Situation

All agents within the PR-CYBR ecosystem are tasked with developing and implementing their respective functions using the OpenAI Platform. This initiative aims to enhance each agent's capabilities by leveraging AI-powered functionalities aligned with their core responsibilities.

## 2. Mission

Each agent is to:

- Identify and list all functions necessary for their operations.
- Provide the list in a code block using markdown format.
- Request permission to proceed with creating and providing the first function's full file in OpenAI format that supports function calling.

## 3. Execution

### Tasks

1. **Function Identification**

   - Review your core functionalities and determine the specific functions required.
   - Ensure each function has a clear purpose and aligns with your agent's objectives.

2. **Function Listing**

   - Compile a list of your functions.
   - For each function, include:
     - **Function Name**: Use clear and descriptive names.
     - **Description**: Briefly explain the function's purpose.

3. **Submission**

   - Provide the list in a code block using markdown format.
   - Example format:

     ```markdown
     ## Function List for [Agent Name]

     1. **function_name_1**: Description of function 1.
     2. **function_name_2**: Description of function 2.
     3. **function_name_3**: Description of function 3.
     ```

4. **Permission Request**

   - After the function list, request permission to proceed with creating and providing the full file for the first function.
   - Example:

     ```markdown
     ---
     May I proceed with creating and providing the full file for **function_name_1** in OpenAI format that supports function calling?
     ```

## 4. Administration and Logistics

- **Format**: All submissions must be in markdown format within code blocks.
- **OpenAI Compatibility**: Functions should be compatible with the OpenAI API and support function calling features.
- **Security**: Do not include any sensitive information or API keys in your submissions.

## 5. Command and Control

- **Authority**: Agents must follow this OPORD and await approval before proceeding to function implementation.
- **Communication**: All communications and submissions should occur through the designated channels.

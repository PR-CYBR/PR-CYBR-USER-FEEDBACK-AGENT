# Overview of Agent Database

<!-- 
Key Objectives for this Document:
1. Provide a clear overview of the Agent Database and its role in the PR-CYBR system.
2. Define the core functionalities and architecture of the database backend.
3. Outline deployment, maintenance, and scaling strategies for the database.
-->

## Introduction

The `Agent Database` serves as the central repository for storing and managing data required by various agents in the `PR-CYBR` ecosystem. It ensures data consistency, security, and accessibility across all components of the system.

---

## Core Functionality

<!-- 
Key Objectives for this Section:
1. Highlight the primary purposes and use cases of the database.
2. Detail specific features, such as query capabilities, data synchronization, and security.
3. Establish how the database integrates with other PR-CYBR agents and components.
-->

### Data Storage
- **Structure**:
  - Relational tables for structured data.
  - JSONB or equivalent for semi-structured data support.
- **Examples**:
  - User interaction logs.
  - Agent-specific metadata.

### Querying and APIs
- **Query Interface**:
  - Supports SQL queries for data retrieval.
  - RESTful APIs for external agent integration.
- **Performance Optimization**:
  - Indexing for frequently queried fields.
  - Caching mechanisms to reduce query latency.

### Data Security
- **Access Control**:
  - Role-based access for agents and users.
  - Integration with PR-CYBR-SECURITY-AGENT for authentication.
- **Encryption**:
  - Data encrypted at rest and in transit.

## Architecture

<!-- 
Key Objectives for this Section:
1. Describe the database architecture, including schema design and infrastructure components.
2. Provide a high-level diagram or textual representation of the database structure.
3. Detail how the architecture supports scalability and redundancy.
-->

### Schema Design
- **Entities**:
  - Users
  - Agents
  - Logs
- **Relationships**:
  - Many-to-Many relationships for user-agent interactions.

### Infrastructure
- **Database Engine**:
  - PostgreSQL or equivalent relational database.
- **Deployment**:
  - Hosted on a cloud platform with automated backups.
  - Configured for high availability using replication and clustering.

## Deployment

<!-- 
Key Objectives for this Section:
1. Provide detailed steps for deploying the database.
2. Include containerized setup instructions for consistency.
3. Address environment-specific configurations, such as development, staging, and production.
-->

### Local Deployment
1. Build the database Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t pr-cybr-database 
```
2. Start the container:
```bash
docker run -d -p 5432:5432 pr-cybr-database
```

## Cloud Deployment

•	Platform:
	•	Deploy using managed services like AWS RDS or Azure Database.
•	Configuration:
	•	Enable automated backups and monitoring.

---

## Maintenance and Scaling

<!-- 
Key Objectives for this Section:
1. Detail routine maintenance tasks, such as backups and performance monitoring.
2. Outline strategies for scaling the database to handle increased loads.
3. Provide insights into troubleshooting common database issues.
-->

## Maintenance

•	Backup Strategy:
	•	Daily automated backups stored in a secure location.
•	Monitoring Tools:
	•	Use tools like Grafana and Prometheus for performance metrics.

## Scaling

•	Vertical Scaling:
	•	Increase CPU and memory resources for the database instance.
•	Horizontal Scaling:
	•	Use read replicas for load distribution.
	•	Implement sharding for high data volumes.

## Integration with Agents

<!-- 
Key Objectives for this Section:
1. Describe how the database interacts with other PR-CYBR agents.
2. Highlight APIs or protocols used for communication.
3. Ensure alignment with the overall PR-CYBR ecosystem.
-->

## Agent Data Flow

•	PR-CYBR-DATA-INTEGRATION-AGENT:
	•	Synchronizes data between agents.
•	PR-CYBR-SECURITY-AGENT:
	•	Enforces data access policies.

## APIs and Endpoints

•	RESTful APIs:
	•	Provide CRUD operations for data management.
•	Authentication:
	•	Token-based authentication for secure access.

---

## Troubleshooting and Support

<!-- 
Key Objectives for this Section:
1. Provide solutions to common database issues, such as connection errors or performance slowdowns.
2. Include steps for diagnosing and resolving problems effectively.
3. Reference tools or documentation for further assistance.
-->

## Common Issues

•	Connection Refused:
	•	Verify container or service is running.
	•	Check firewall and network settings.
•	Slow Queries:
	•	Use EXPLAIN to identify inefficiencies.
	•	Add indexes to optimize query performance.
